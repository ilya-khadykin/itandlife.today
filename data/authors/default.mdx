My name is Ilya, and I'm a programmer with more than 8 years of experience.
<br/>Welcome to my website and blog where I share my experience about things I learned from past projects and outside work.

During my journey in IT I was working as a NOC operator, Test Automation Engineer, Test Lead, Site Reliability Engineer and Key Software Developer.
At the moment, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at EPAM Systems Inc.

I've been using different technologies including:
- Java (mostly Spring + other JVM languages like Groovy and Scala)
- Python (for scripting and Data Science or Data Engineering work)
- JavaScript (React, Angular, node.js; this website is built using Next.js)
- AWS Cloud (AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS S3, AWS SQS, AWS SNS, AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudFormation, AWS RDS, AWS DynamoDB)
- GCP

I'm planning to write about different things, not specifically related to technologies mentioned above. Stay tuned!
