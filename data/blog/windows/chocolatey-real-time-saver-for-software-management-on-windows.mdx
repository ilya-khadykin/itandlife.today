## Why installing or upgrading software on Windows is problematic

One of the best things about Unix systems is its built-in package managers. Most Unix users do not even think how
cumbersome it is to install or update software on Windows, all this hassle of downloading an installation
package, running it, giving instructions, and so on. And I did not even mention the update process. It’s a big pain.

Imagine a way of installing software on Windows just by issuing one simple command, it sounds like a dream, doesn’t it?

## Chocolatey to the rescue

I thought so myself, but there is an existing production-ready solution for this problem, and it is called
[Chocolatey - The Package Manager for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/)

It is a shame to admit that I discovered this tool only one year ago (or so).

How many packages are available? At the time of writing 7872 community maintained packages are available.

Now my life is much easier if I need to reinstall my Windows system or prepare a new machine.
It is a matter of running one simple command like `choco install jre8` or run a script to install a list of software you need:

**It is a real time saver and highly recommended!**
